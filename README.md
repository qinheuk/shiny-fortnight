This is an open source project for application of cycloid needle reducer. The target is of relatively small capacity application.It is possible to use this model in envelope of 50 x 50mm.Such as wrist drive or enven smaller location.
It is possible to print all the parts of the Cycloid needle reducer by 3D Printer.Of course,the low surface accracy quality will affect the rotating stability somehow. You can see the rotating ripple is very small. The peak to peak displacement is around 1micro if all parts are made in steel. Of course,plastic will make the deformation a little bit larger at the same load level. No micro geometry is available and practical in print procedure. So a reasonable clearance will be very sensitive and important. In term of durability, prediction method will be given in the following documents(no timeline).
Only geometry model will be built via FreeCAD, to provide input for 3D print process.Metal piece will have much better durability performance if applying grinding method.  The shortage of high accuracy steel parts are heavier and more costy than print one.The advantage is of high transmission accuracy with much smaller clearance being applied.
