This is an open source project for application of cycloid needle reducer. The target application is of relativly small capacity.
It is possible to print all the parts of the Cycoid needle reducer by 3D Printer.Of course,the low surface accracy quality will affect the rotating stability somehow.In term of durability, prediction method will be given in the following documents.
